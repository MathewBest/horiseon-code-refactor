# horiseon-code-refactor

## Description

This is a refactor of the Horiseon website. This was done to improve SEO and accessibility of the website. I set out to do this through consolidating CSS selectors and properties, updating code to semantic HTML and including e.g. accessible 'alt' tags to images.
